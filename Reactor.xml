    A watchpoint is a location on the file system that will be synchronized to a corresponding location on a
    cloud service.  The target cloud location needs to have been configured already with rclone.
  
    It is HIGHLY recommended that you not use Reactor to INITIALIZE storage on a cloud service.  Such actions
    can easily take many hours, if not days.  Reactor is intended to maintain incremental updates of existing
    storage, not full transfers of massive amounts of data.

            You can add rclone options that will be specific to this remote or the files in this watchpoint.
            Be careful which options you provide; Reactor uses its own in order to function, so you need to
            take pains not to duplicate (and thus, override) them here.

            On startup, each watchpoint remote can be configured to perform a complete sync so it is has a
            "clean slate".  This can be for a one-off (e.g., full sync once a day), or it can serve as a sane
            stateu for subsequent incremental updates.  It is highly recommended that this be enabled if you
            are using Reactor in a fire-and-forget scenario (i.e., start on log-in) so any incremental syncs
            keep the remote exactly mirrored.

            Clean-slate updates are executed in parallel among the configured rclone remotes.
          -->
          <cleanSlate value="true"/>
          <!--
            The heart and soul of Reactor is the incremental update.  While having clean-slate updates occur
            when Reactor starts is highly useful in and of itself, performing incremental updates in reaction
            to file-system changes keeps your remote instantly synchronized with the state of the local system.

        As file events occur on a watchpoint, there may be a flurry that could (unnecessarily) cause multiple
        sync tasks to be queued on the same watchpoint location.  In order to batch such events, you can specify
        the number of seconds of "calm" that must pass on the watchpoint before synchronizing is scheduled.

        If more events occur on the watchpoint before this timer decays, it will be reset.

      <!--
        A process predicate causes file events that match a regular expression to be discarded while the
        indicated processs is currently running.  This is useful in cases where the process constantly makes
        file modifications while it is runnning, so you can avoid numerous rclone calls.

        Note that you should NOT apply this to a process that does not perform one or more file modifications on
        exit, otherwise sync events will likely not be triggered.  If you are in doubt, enable the 'dryRun' option
        and then watch the log output of Reactor to see how the process behaves with regard to file changes.
